* 1 minor enhancement

  * I found that usage quite often has the empty string in the replace portion
    so I added a special usage (for pipes) that defaults the replacement
    to the empty string.  Therefore if you're using TextMate or something, you
    can filter the docment on a regex, stripping out whatever matches.
